Summary:
Artificial intelligence is the science, and engineering of making intelligent machines especially intelligent computer programs . It is concerned with getting computers to do tasks that would normally require human intelligence systems are basically software systems, or controllers for robots that use techniques such as machine learning, and deep learning to solve problems in particular domains without hard coding all possibilities that is algorithm steps in software engineering .
