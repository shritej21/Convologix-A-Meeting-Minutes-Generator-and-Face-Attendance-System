Convologix - A Meeting Minutes Generator and Face Attendance System

The motivation behind the project stems from the inefficiencies of manual meeting
minute generation and attendance recording, aiming to enhance accuracy,
save time, foster collaboration, and provide data-driven insights. The objectives
include conducting a literature survey, analyzing unexplored potentials,
preparing data for analysis, generating concise summaries from audio content,
identifying faces for attendance tracking, and associating speech segments with
respective speakers.
The project falls within the area of study of Machine Learning and Deep Learning.
The methodology involves analyzing requirements, selecting appropriate
technologies, collecting diverse datasets, developing models iteratively, implementing
real-time facial recognition, and conducting thorough testing and user
training. The project aims to revolutionize meeting management by automating
the generation of meeting minutes, improving attendance tracking, and enhancing
the overall meeting experience.
